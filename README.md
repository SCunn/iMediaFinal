Interactive Media Final Project

This project explores interactive potential of electrical field sensing by the means of Capacitive technology.
It is because of the technologies low-cost and versatility that it is relatively easy to apply the technology
into everyday objects, an area that can be explored by using off-the-shelf materials.

It is the simplification of the technology that makes it inclusive to all and paves the way for exploring easy
to apply prototyping tools. The goal of this project was to create an interactive audio visual installation that
explores low tech solutions for prototyping with interactive technologies. This project used used serial communication
between an Arduino Uno board and a PC, sending sensor data from the Arduino board, and receiving it on the Processing IDE on a computer.

This project used the Arduino CapSense Library by Paul Badger, and the SerialCallResponse sketches by Tom Igoe and Scott Fitzgearld.
